INTRODUCTION: This app was postponed due to holidays. I will be caught up by the end of this coming weekend.

As with the previous app, I am unable to get this app to run properly due to bugs; likely, because this app is based off an example written in Python 3.1, and I am running Python 3.3.2. I will read up on the differences between the different point versions, to avoid these problems in the future.

DOCUMENTATION: This is a Hangman game, with a limited number of potential words to guess.

WHAT I LEARNED: That I need to read up on the differences between Python 3.3.2 and Python 3.1.
